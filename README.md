# A  ci/cd project with git, jenkins, ArgoCD, kubernetes



## Tools I Used

-  **Github** as repo source
- **Jenkins** for continous Integration
- **python flask** the framework
- **Docker** inorder to containerize the app
-  **Kubernetes** inorder to orchestrate the containerized app
-  **GitOps argoCD** inorder to monitors your running infrastructure (the actual state) to compare it to declaratively-defined coded app (the desired state or target state) to determine whether they are out of sync, which helps to remediate configuration drift.
